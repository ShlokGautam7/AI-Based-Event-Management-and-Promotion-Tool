# 🚀 Event Manager (AI-Powered)

A **Flask-based AI-powered event management system** that helps users create, edit, delete, and view events.  
It also generates **smart promotional messages** for each event automatically to make sharing easier.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Managing events often becomes messy — people forget dates, details, or struggle to promote their events effectively.  
Traditional event managers only store event information but do not help in **event promotion**.  

This project addresses the problem by not only storing and managing event details but also **auto-generating promotional content** to attract participants.
